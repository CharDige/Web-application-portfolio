# Web-application-portfolio

## About the project

This project is my web application portfolio, which highlights who I am and showcases some of my web development work for employers to see. As I continue to develop and complete further projects, the more I will add to showcase my skills to potential future employers.

## User story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Technologies used

- HTML
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/)
- CSS

## The process

Initially, we created a portfolio page from scratch using the limited knowledge and experience we had. I've now been able to expand on this by using the CSS Framework Bootstrap to increase the responsiveness of the page and simplify the code.

I also ensured I still kept my portfolio page looking a certain way that showed a bit of personalisation, such as including my favourite colour green prominently.

### Wireframe

When I first developed my initial portfolio, I created a wireframe of my desired structure. This is still similar to what I have in my currently updated portfolio, as it allows a clean and professional look.

## Challenges

In the initial creation of this portfolio, I faced many challenges to get the page displaying the way I wanted it to. This included using the `position` CSS property and building my confidence in using `flex`.

Updating this portfolio using what I've learnt so far in the course allowed me to remove some of the pain points in the code and still deliver a responsive and clean web application. The greatest challenge was ensuring all changes I made to implement Bootstrap didn't impact other functionality.

## What I learnt

Between when I first created this portfolio to now, I have learnt a lot and have become more confident in being able to deliver responsive and clean web applications efficiently.

I have also become a lot more confident in reading code without needing to look at the web application in a browser, which has helped streamline a lot of time in going back and forth between Google DevTools and VS Code.
